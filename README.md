# Django-Flask-Development-internship-Assignment
This is my assignment code for the Django Flask Development internship.
You have to run the app.py file from the code.
In this code, all the fuctionalities are working well. Except the reset-password. Reset-password will only show on screen that reset link is send on the email. But actually it is not sending any link on the email. I have tried it but can't succed in that. So we can't change the password once assigned.
I have completed the 3rd session of assignment(comments, post) and its running also.
